PulseWidth is a collection of little ruby scripts for interfacing to RC Servos and related tech, for controlling animatronics using wav files and the likes, portably. 

## ServoAnimation class ##

This little class lets you write mono wav files, with an animation sequence, which will be encoded in to PWM codes, and saved as #{Class Name}.wav in the current directory, when you inherit a class from it. Check out servo-animation-samples.rb for a little demo. You can't make instances of these classes. They are fakey like that.

More to comeâ€¦
